# pokemonwebsite
### Welcome to my practise website 
This is a website with a React front-end, Express backend and a MongoDB seeded database. It also connects to the PokeAPI.co API.<br/><br/>You will need to run a 'npm install' inside both the '/pokemonwebsite/frontend' and 'pokemonwebsite/backend' folders.<br/><br/>This repo does not contain images for the Pokemon components. You need need to add a folder called 'pokemon' inside of pokemonwebsite/frontend/src/images/<br/>The folder needs to contain images for pokemon 1-809 in the format 'xxx.png'<br/>For example Bulbasaur would be '001.png' Pikachu would be '025.png' Mewtwo would be '150.png'<br/>Images are available at the repo [fanzeyi/pokemon.json](https://github.com/fanzeyi/pokemon.json) (you will need to edit the filenames for 662 and 740)<br/><br/>To run this website, open your Terminal and 'cd' in to '/pokemonwebsite' and run 'docker-compose up -d --build"
