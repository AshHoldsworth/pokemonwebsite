# pokemonwebsite

# Welcome to my practise website.

# This is a website with a React front-end, Express backend and a MongoDB seeded database. It also connects to the PokeAPI.co API.
# You will need to run a 'npm install' inside both the '/pokemonwebsite/frontend' and 'pokemonwebsite/backend' folders.
# To run this website, open your Terminal and 'cd' in to '/pokemonwebsite' and run 'docker-compose up -d --build"
# This repo does not contain images for the Pokemon components. You need need to add a folder called 'pokemon' inside of pokemonwebsite/frontend/src/images/
# The folder needs to contain images for pokemon 1-809 in the format 'xxx.png'
# For example Bulbsaur would be '001.png' Mewtwo would be '150.png'
